# Techincal Event Model (TEM) Specification

## Introduction 

In today's complex distributed systems, understanding what's happening across multiple services, processes, and business workflows has become increasingly challenging. The *Technical Event Model* emerges as a crucial architectural pattern that addresses this challenge by providing a standardized framework for representing and tracking all significant occurrences within a system.

This specification defines the Technical Event Model (TEM), a standardized framework for event representation, processing, and analysis in distributed systems. The TEM establishes consistent patterns for event communication, enabling comprehensive system observability, process tracking, and performance analysis.

The Technical Event Model enables complete visibility into distributed system operations through standardized event structures. This observability encompasses both technical operations and business processes, providing a foundation for:
- Distributed tracing
- Abalysis capabilities
- Standardization
- Scalability

### Distributed Tracing

Event correlation across distributed services enables end-to-end transaction tracking. This capability provides complete visibility into request flows, service dependencies, and processing paths through complex distributed architectures.

- **State Tracking**: Continuous monitoring of system state changes through event sequences ensures accurate system state reconstruction. This tracking enables reliable debugging, audit processes, and system behavior analysis.

- **Performance Monitoring**: Standardized performance metric collection across system components enables comprehensive performance analysis. This monitoring includes latency measurements, resource utilization tracking, and service level agreement verification.

- **Process Management**
The model implements hierarchical process tracking through standardized identifiers and relationships:

  - **Process Hierarchy**: Clearly defined relationships between origin, parent, and current processes enable accurate tracking of process execution chains. This hierarchy supports both synchronous and asynchronous processing patterns.
  - **Transaction Correlation**: Consistent correlation mechanisms link related events across distributed processes. This correlation enables reconstruction of complete transaction flows and process relationships.
  - **State Management**: Explicit state transition tracking through events enables accurate process state management. This capability supports both technical and business process state tracking.

### Analysis Capabilities

The event model supports comprehensive analysis across multiple dimensions:

- **Technical Analysis**: Standardized event structures enable detailed technical analysis of system behavior, performance patterns, and resource utilization. This analysis supports optimization, capacity planning, and problem resolution.
- **Business Analysis**: Business process visibility through technical events enables analysis of business operations, transaction patterns, and process effectiveness. This capability bridges technical operations and business processes.
- **Compliance Verification**: Complete event tracking supports automated compliance verification and audit processes. This verification includes both technical compliance and business rule adherence.

### Standardization

The Technical Event Model provides:

- **Consistent Processing**: Standardized event structures ensure uniform processing across system components. This consistency reduces integration complexity and improves system reliability.
- **Clear Interfaces**: Well-defined event formats and processing requirements enable clear service interfaces. This clarity simplifies system integration and reduces development complexity.
- **Verifiable Compliance**: Standard event structures support automated validation and compliance verification. This capability ensures consistent event quality across the system.

### Scalability

The model supports system growth through:

- **Volume Management**: Efficient event structures and processing patterns enable handling of increasing event volumes. This efficiency supports system growth without proportional complexity increase.
- **Component Independence**: Standardized interfaces enable independent scaling of system components. This independence supports flexible system evolution and resource optimization.

### Maintainability

The specification ensures sustainable system evolution through:

- **Version Control**: Clear versioning requirements enable controlled evolution of event definitions. This control ensures backward compatibility and smooth system updates.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive specification of event structures and processing requirements provides clear implementation guidance. This documentation supports consistent system development and maintenance.
- **Technical Requirements**: The Technical Event Model implements these capabilities through specific requirements in:
  - **Event Structure**: Detailed specification of event formats, required attributes, and data types.
  - **Processing Rules**: Clear definition of event processing requirements, validation rules, and handling procedures.
  - **Integration Patterns**: Specification of integration requirements, protocol standards, and interface definitions.

This specification provides the technical foundation for implementing these capabilities while ensuring system scalability, reliability, and maintainability.
